This package is a clone of the SVN repo for the Wordpress theme `edin`.

It contains a [single commit](https://github.com/DAZSERMgmt/edin/commit/4d86f7fc74f974adbe5da496bda1415a3966b1d5) to add the Social bar to the header.

Steps to deploy:
- Update to latest tag
- Publish to `/mnt/efs/fs1/wordpress/wp-content/themes/edin` on the Wordpress server. (I'm using a docker instance of wordpress)
